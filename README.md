## What It Is & How It Works

I wanted to design an app that generated curated walks to view art around Brooklyn, and came up with this idea in my quest to find a good resource that would give my friends and family a guide to art venues around the city.

This app works by generating distinct walks with points that correspond to different art galleries, museums, and shops around Brooklyn. Each route is semantically named and shows users a polyline route that they can follow for a walking trip around the city. Users can favorite a given artwalk, give their favorite a new name (if desired), and delete the favorite as necessary.

I would like to enhance this app moving forward by allowing users to add points to their favorite routes, and add an animation that draws the route in real time.

## Development Process

1. Research app requirements and technologies.
2. Write out user stories for app.
3. Create wireframes for app.
4. Craft a list of necessary parts.
5. Devise a version control workflow:
  -   Branch large-scope features such as 'front-end' or 'back-end' off of 'master', and then branch smaller feature branches off of those.
  -   Begin coding.
  -   Revisit list of necessary parts needed.
6. Revise version control workflow:
  -   Create a 'development' branch and for each feature make a single branch off of it, then merge that branch back into 'development'.
  -   Finally, merge back into 'master'. Also, create a 'to-do' list that is added to when coding and coming across issues or thinking of ideas, so that the focus is only on one problem at a time.
7. Revise code, spending time focusing on the requirements as opposed to interesting problems that are unimportant.
8. Once code is in a 'near-production' state, spend time working on testing as many possible use-cases as possible.
9. Once satisfied with completion of tests, remove all debugger, console.log, and other WIP code.
10. Deploy finalized project to GitHub Pages and test functionality again.
11. Write README file based off of notes.
12. Push final README to 'master' branch.
